The figures indicate that the house size and the total quality are closely tied with SalePrice. Some of the characteristics are skewed towards the right and have outliers. The Correlation analysis indicates that there is a level of collinearity within size related features, but no other feature is eliminated at this point. The data is made clean and it can be further modelled.
